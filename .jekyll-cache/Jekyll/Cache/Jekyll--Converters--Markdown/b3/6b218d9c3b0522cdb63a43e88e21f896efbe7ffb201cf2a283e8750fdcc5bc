_Lorem ipsum_, or _lipsum_ as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs. The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero's _De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum_ for use in a type specimen book. It usually begins with:

&gt; “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.”

The purpose of _lorem ipsum_ is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout. A practice not without [controversy](https://loremipsum.io/#controversy "Controversy in the Design World"), laying out pages with meaningless filler text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.

The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used it on their dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled the text with their software. Today it's seen all around the web; on templates, websites, and stock designs.

# How To Use Bullet Points (:)

Bullet points are used to draw attention to important information within a document so that a reader can identify the key issues and facts quickly. There are no fixed rules about how to use them, but here are some guidelines:

1.The text introducing the list of bullet points should end with a <a href="https://www.lexico.com/grammar/bullet-points">colon</a>.

2. If the text that follows the bullet point is not a proper sentence, it doesn’t need to begin with a capital letter, nor end with a <a href="https://www.lexico.com/grammar/period-full-stop" title="Period (.)">period</a>. For example:

<em>Tonight’s agenda includes:</em>

* <em>annual review of capital gains issues</em>
* <a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/outstanding"><em>outstanding</em></a> <em>inheritance tax issues</em>

3. If the text following the bullet point is a complete sentence, it should begin with a capital letter, while a period at the end is technically required but is not absolutely essential:

<em>The</em> <a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/agenda"><em>agenda</em></a> <em>for tonight is as follows:</em>

* <em>We will conduct an annual review of capital gains issues.</em>
* <em>Attorney Sanso will talk about outstanding inheritance tax issues.</em>

4. Lists of bullet points will have more impact if each one begins with the same <a href="https://www.lexico.com/grammar/word-classes-or-parts-of-speech">word class (part of speech)</a> and if they are all of a similar length. Action verbs are a good choice for the first word—i.e., verbs that describe the performing of an action. If you do use verbs, make sure that each one is in the same tense. Here’s an example of the effective use of action verbs in a person’s résumé:

Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College, is [credited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum "Wikipedia – Lorem Ipsum") with discovering the source behind the ubiquitous filler text. In seeing a sample of _lorem ipsum_, his interest was piqued by _consectetur_—a genuine, albeit rare, Latin word. Consulting a Latin dictionary led McClintock to a passage from _De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum_ (“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”), a first-century B.C. text from the Roman philosopher Cicero.

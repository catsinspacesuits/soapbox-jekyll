OUR RESEARCH TEAM

As an experienced, international, inter-disciplinary team of three female researchers from three continents, we are extremely well-placed to undertake this complex research project. Specifically, we have the following to offer:

· excellent research skills built up through vast collective professional experience in labour research projects and labour support organisations in several countries

· intimate, contextual knowledge of the political, economic, legal and labour situations of our respective countries (Colombia, the UK, and South Africa) and regions (South America, Africa, and Europe)

· extensive networks and contacts in the international labour movement (particularly in South America, Europe and Africa), as well as membership in international labour research networks, such as GLU.
